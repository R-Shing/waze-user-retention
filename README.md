## Project Overview

User churn — when users stop using an app — is a critical metric for any tech product. Understanding the factors influencing churn helps businesses improve user experience, increase customer lifetime value, and reduce acquisition costs.

In this analysis, Waze user behavior data was explored to:

- Identify patterns and trends linked to churn
- Develop a predictive model to forecast user churn
- Recommend targeted business interventions to improve retention
